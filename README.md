RackTk
======

RackTk is a command-line toolkit for working with computer clusters.
The Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) has been building up this toolkit over
the time out of the need to make life easier for administrators of
commodity-hardware computer clusters.  The toolkit features parallel
shell, parallel copy, and simple tools for netinstall management.  One
key feature in RackTk is flexible host selection syntax, also available
as a Perl module for reuse in applications.

RackTk is useful for system administrators seeking command-line tools
with a small footprint for their computer clusters.
